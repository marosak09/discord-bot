# discord-bot
my discord bot project created in python

How to run:
-install all requirements

invite your discord bot to your discord server and replace TOKEN with your discord bot token and initialize your firebase database.
Run python file or host it somewhere and type .help to chat

This is my side project so it isn't that good but I think it's usable for smaller discord servers.
Also i know that code is very bad but I just edited my very old code and i am lazy so i leave it like this.
